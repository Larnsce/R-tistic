# How to use R dplyr mutate() to manipulate character variable

I am working with a dataset that uses two different character strings to identify a number countries in one variable. For example, both `uganda_17` and `uganda` are included as different observations. My goal is to transform all observations that contain "_15" to observations that do not include this string and therefore match with the other observations.

```{r}

rm(list = ls())

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

tibble_df <- tibble(country = c("uganda", "uganda_17", "brazil", "brazil_17", "poland", "poland_17"), year = c("2015", "2017", "2015", "2017", "2015", "2017"))


tibble_df %>% 
  separate(
    col = country,
    into = c("country", "delete"),
    sep = "_17"
  ) %>% 
  select(-delete)

  


```
