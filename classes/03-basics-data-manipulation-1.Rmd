### Why that name?

"Slack" in Urban Dictionary:

> An approach where one stops trying to make things happen or exert control, and instead simply "allows" or "lets" favorable events occur.

When you use Slack, you wait for things to happen to you most of the time!

### How is that efficient?

> You: Isn't adding Slack to my tool set extra overhead?
>> Me: Maybe! 

--

> You: I am not convinced, it's going to be more overhead for me. Give me some good reasons to use it. 
>> Me: Get ready, I am about to blow your mind!
