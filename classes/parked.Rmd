## Exercise 
***

6. Visualise the number of observations (count) per destination

```{r}

ggplot(data = flights_summary_filter, mapping = aes(x = mean_dist, y = mean_delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)


```

## Exercise 
***
### Use the pipe

```{r mpg-facetting, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9, warning=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dev='CairoSVG'}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)

```

```{r}

flights_plot <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
 
ggplot(data = flights_plot, mapping = aes(x = mean_dist, y = mean_delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)


```
